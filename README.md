# SST Service with a fk-nat NAT

Combines SST [Service](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/Service) construct with [fck-nat](https://fck-nat.dev/stable/) custom NAT. It's much (90%) cheaper.

# How to use this

If you've setup SST you can clone this repo and deploy it with your own credentials.

```
sst deploy --stage dev
```

Otherwise copy and paste what you need out of `./stacks/MyStack`
